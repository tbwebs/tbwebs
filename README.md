## Hi, Iâ€™m Trey! 
- I'm currently working through a training program to earn my Pega Systems CSSA. I'm interested in software development, data science, automation, and AI. I'm proficient in Java, Python, PostgreSQL, and a little front end tech. I really enjoy collaborating with others so don't be afraid to get in touch with me, unless your a Sp\*ds supporter (jk).
